## Things to do before starting
### field design
as usual, but prefer some buffer plots for gps and other markers
### GCP （Ground Control Points）
there's lots of discussions about the **Number and distribution of GCPs**  
here are some article for GCPs setup  
[Pix4d_1](https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202557489) [Pix4D_2](https://support.pix4d.com/hc/en-us/articles/202559299-Number-and-distribution-of-ground-control-points-GCPs-in-corridor-mapping)  
and also a lot of researchers on optimization of placing GCPs, most of them were satellite image related, here list up some UAV related articles:  
* [Ground-Control Networks for Image Based Surface Reconstruction: An Investigation of Optimum Survey Designs Using UAV Derived Imagery and Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/9/786)  
* [Determining the Optimum Number of Ground Control Points for Obtaining High Precision Results Based on UAS Images](http://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/2/7/352)
* to be continue

Note, recently the RTK-based drone are getting popular, so that in the near feature, we may not need GCPs.

#### GCPs we are using now.
### Calibration
#### Color/radiometric calibration
#### Point Cloud calibration
