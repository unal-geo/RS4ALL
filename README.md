## Welcome to Remote Sensing for All Lab

The challenges of sustainable development require new forms of research or cooperation. It is only trough collective learning that the ideas of individuals can turn into actions.

Remote sensing data and technologies provide an unique opportunity to understanding territories and to reshape our thinking for achieving the objectives of sustainable development. Our Lab is committed to diffuse remote sensing concepts, techniques and tools that may help to transform the society.
